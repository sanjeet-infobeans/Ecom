Project Requirement Document: AI-Powered Document Management SaaS Platform

üìÖ Project Title:
CompliDocs ‚Äî A Multi-Tenant Document Management System for Audit & Compliance Processes
üíº Stakeholders:
Product Owner: Sanjeet Patel


Business Analyst: ChatGPT (BA Mode)


Technical Project Manager: ChatGPT (TPM Mode)


End Users: Project Managers, Architects, QA, Developers, Finance, Clients, Auditors



‚úÖ Project Overview:
CompliDocs is a SaaS-based platform that enables organizations to manage, discover, and track audit- and compliance-related documents across SDLC phases, adhering to standards such as CMMI Level 3, CMMI Level 5, and ISO.
Each company registers its account and customizes its process documents and audit practices. Employees access the platform via subdomain or slug-based URLs, perform role-based scenario queries (e.g., "Client Onboarding"), and use AI tools to find relevant process templates.
